## Antiquity and Early Classification

Oral cavity cancers are among the earliest malignancies documented in human history. Ancient medical texts from Egypt and India (c. 3000 BCE) describe ulcerative lesions of the mouth that were resistant to treatment and often fatal. The Greek philosopher Hippocrates later classified such growths as karkinos (cancer), recognizing their invasive and destructive nature. However, early physicians lacked both the anatomical knowledge and diagnostic tools necessary to distinguish malignant lesions from infections or trauma.

## Middle Ages and Renaissance

During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, oral cancers were primarily diagnosed by gross visual inspection and palpation. Lesions that were persistent, ulcerated, indurated, or bleeding were considered spiritually ominous. Treatment was largely surgical and rudimentary, often involving cauterization or excision without anesthesia. Thus, prognosis for oral cavity cancers was quite poor, largely due to late detection and the absence of standardized diagnostic criteria.

## The 18th and 19th Centuries

However, a major conceptual shift occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries, when pathological anatomy and microscopy emerged. Italian anatomist Giovanni Battista Morgagni and later German physician Rudolf Virchow established that cancers arose from abnormal cells rather than imbalances of bodily humors (blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm). This period marked the beginning of histopathology, which would become the gold standard for cancer diagnosis for most of the modern era.

## The Early 20th Century

By the early 20th century, oral cavity cancers like oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) were recognized as distinct clinical entities.  Epidemiological studies began linking oral cancer to tobacco use, including cigarette smoking and smokeless tobacco consumption. Meanwhile, in South and Southeast Asia, betel nut (areca nut) chewing was identified as a major carcinogenic risk factor. Subsequently, scalpel biopsy procedures were rapidly adopted worldwide, building upon previous advances in histopathology to aid in the diagnosis of oral cavity cancers.

## The Late 20th Century

In the late 20th century, new diagnostic methods that were relatively less invasive than their predecessors were developed. Oral brush biopsies became widely used in place of invasive scalpel biopsies to collect dysplastic cells for histopathological analysis. More recently, fluorescence-based-imaging has been tested for the diagnosis of oral lesions, indicating a shift from histopathology to optical analysis.
