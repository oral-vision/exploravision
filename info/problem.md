# The Problem

<div class="box">
<p><strong>The Challenge</strong>: Underprivileged communities around the world suffer from disproportionately high rates of oral cavity cancers and periodontal diseases, often lacking the expensive medical screening technology required to diagnose these potentially dangerous, but highly-treatable conditions.</p>
</div>

## Customer Need

The healthcare gap in underserved communities is significant:

<ul>
	<li>Disproportionately high rates of oral cavity cancers</li>
	<li>Increased prevalence of periodontal diseases</li>
	<li>Lack of affordable diagnostic technology</li>
	<li>Limited access to life-saving screening tools</li>
	<li>Highly-treatable conditions going undiagnosed</li>
</ul>

*The challenge: Lack of affordable diagnostic tools in underserved communities*

## Existing Alternatives

Modern diagnostic solutions exist, but they come with significant barriers:

<blockquote>Instead of advanced diagnostic tools, low-income communities often have to rely on ineffective visual examinations to diagnose these conditions, leading to missed diagnoses and delayed treatment.</blockquote>

<div class="row">
	<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
		<h3>The Impact</h3>
		<p>Physicians in low-income communities lack the monetary resources required to purchase expensive intraoral diagnostic equipment for their clinics.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
		<h3>The Consequence</h3>
		<p>This results in frequent faulty diagnoses that undermine healthcare systems in these underserved communities.</p>
