## Customer Segments

Our target audience consists of physicians in low-income communities who face significant challenges:

<ul>

	<li>Experience frequent faulty diagnoses due to limited diagnostic capabilities</li>
	<li>Serve communities with disproportionately high rates of oral diseases</li>
	<li>Undermine healthcare systems in underserved areas due to diagnostic limitations</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Physicians in low-income communities are our target audience.
